I am a senior at Appalachian State University working towards a bachelors in mathematics. I will be graduating in May 2018 and hope to begin my career in data analytics in August. I currently work as a director for a non-profit summer camp located in Boone, NC. In my free time, I love being outside and cuddling with my hairless cat, Milo!
