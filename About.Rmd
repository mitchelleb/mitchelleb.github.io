I recently graduated from Appalachian State University with a bachelors degree in Mathematics and a concentration in Life Sciences. My major and concentration are both due to my passion for research based learning and data analytics. I currently work as a director for a non-profit summer camp located in Boone, NC. In my free time, I love being outside and cuddling with my hairless cat, Milo!
